# CH CTF Challenges

Hello and welcome to this small CTF!

## Challenges

4 small challenges have been prepared. Hopefully I got the difficulty level
right, but always a challenge.

I tried to make them semi-realistic. You get source code for all of them, which
is written in Python 3.

## Flags

All Flags have the following format:

`CH{FLAG_HERE}`
